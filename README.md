About The Project
Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. This project will include building a weather dashboard using the OpenWeather API and/or DarkSky API as per user's spefications.

User Stories
As a traveler
I want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that I can plan a trip accordingly
Development Strategy
Use the OpenWeather API and/or DarkSky API to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions.

Use AJAX to hook into the API to retrieve data in JSON format.

App should be able to run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Display the following under current weather conditions:

City
Date
Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
Temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
UV index
Include a search history so that users can access their past search terms. Clicking on the city name should perform a new search that returns current and future conditions for that city.

Include a 5-Day Forecast below the current weather conditions. Each day for the 5-Day Forecast should display the following:

Date
Icon image (visual representation of weather conditions)
Temperature
Humidity
Demo
